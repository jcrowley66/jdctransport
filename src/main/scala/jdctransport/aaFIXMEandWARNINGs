WARNINGs
--------
If compiled with Java 9 or above, get: java.lang.NoSuchMethodError: java.nio.ByteBuffer.position(I)Ljava/nio/ByteBuffer;
See this writeup: https://www.morling.dev/blog/bytebuffer-and-the-dreaded-nosuchmethoderror/

NOTE: the --release=8 settings in IntelliJ did not seem to solve the problem. Finally had to execute under Java 17
FIXMEs
------
-- define a stop() method which will shut down a Transport
  -- remove from active list
  -- terminate all of the actors
  -- call the transIsStopping method of the Application (in the trait)
-- define a TransportThrottle(set:Boolean) method to Transport itself
  -- can be sent by other party (e.g. SDMXchange server) as backpressure
  -- True == set a flag, block on all sendMessage calls
  -- false == unset the flag
?? Make the backpressureHigh/Low settings vars & allow TransportThrottle to modify???

-- In FileTransfer did not test the isGrowing logic AT ALL
